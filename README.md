# 🚀 HRMS Backend (Enterprise Spring Boot Project)

A production-ready **Human Resource Management System (HRMS) backend** built using **Spring Boot**.
This project demonstrates enterprise backend architecture including **JWT authentication, role-based authorization, Flyway database migrations, Docker containerization, Swagger documentation, and monitoring with Spring Boot Actuator**.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

This backend provides secure REST APIs for managing HR operations such as employee management, authentication, and audit logging.

The system is designed following **clean architecture principles** and **enterprise backend best practices**.

Key design goals:

* Scalable architecture
* Secure authentication system
* Versioned database schema
* Containerized deployment
* Production-ready monitoring

---

# 🏗 Architecture

The project follows a **layered architecture**.

```
controller → service → repository → database
```

Project structure:

```
src/main/java/com/example/HRMS
│
├── config          # Security, JWT, CORS, OpenAPI configuration
├── controller      # REST API controllers
├── dto             # Request / Response models
├── entity          # Database entities
├── exception       # Global exception handling
├── repository      # Spring Data JPA repositories
├── service         # Business logic
│   ├── ai          # AI integration scaffold
│   └── impl
└── HRMSApplication
```

# 🔐 Security Features

* JWT based authentication
* Refresh token support
* BCrypt password hashing
* Role based access control
* Permission based authorization
* Method level security
* Custom authentication entry points
* Access denied handling

---

# 🗄 Database Management

The project uses **Flyway for database migrations**.

Benefits:

* Version controlled database schema
* Safe production deployments
* Automated migrations

Migration scripts are located in:

```
src/main/resources/db/migration
```

---

# 🐳 Docker Deployment

The backend can run fully inside Docker.

### Build and Run

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This starts:

* Spring Boot application
* MySQL database container

---

# 📑 API Documentation

Swagger UI is available at:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

You can test secured APIs directly using the **JWT token**.

---

# 📊 Monitoring

Spring Boot Actuator provides monitoring endpoints.

Health check:

```
http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

Application info:

```
http://localhost:8080/actuator/info
```

---

# 🧠 AI Integration (Scaffold)

The project includes a placeholder service for future AI integrations.

Example endpoint:

```
GET /api/v1/ai/analyze
```

This module can later integrate:

* Machine Learning models
* Python microservices
* OpenAI APIs
* Predictive HR analytics

---

# 🌐 Default Endpoints

Authentication:

```
POST /api/v1/auth/login
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
```

Employee APIs:

```
GET /api/v1/employees
POST /api/v1/employees
```

AI Module:
